The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
computing.

### Jupyter notebook, the language-agnostic evolution of IPython notebook
Jupyter notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application for
Project Jupyter. In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part of
The Big Split™ of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithic
release containing both language-agnostic code, such as the *IPython notebook*,
and language specific code, such as the *IPython kernel for Python*. As
computing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop the
language-agnostic **Jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of the
community develop language specific kernels which are found in their own
discrete repos.
